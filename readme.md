## Significance of Charcoal
Pencils are convenient because most people have easy access to them. Paint is popular because the colors involved excite even young children. 
But when trying to depict an image in 3D, an artist focuses, not on the colors, but on the lights and darks of the image – the shadows and the highlights. 
It is the varying tones of lights and darks that can transform a flat, white canvas into a 3D image that appears to be protruding from the canvas’s surface.
Charcoal is the ideal tool for capturing the contrasting shades in the world because of its ability to render both extreme lights and extreme darks.
